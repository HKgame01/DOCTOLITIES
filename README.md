# ☁️ Inspiration
Based on the health/medical and open innovation website, we were inspired to create a health and innovative website that provides you with a login feature and leads to a petition to sign, feedback, a greeting card, and solutions to solve medical problems.

# 🚧 What It Does
As said above, this website provides health tools and a greeting card. The website first has a petition that you can sign, some solutions, and a feedback page for doctors. 

# 🛠️ How We Built It
Using Linode's one-click stack scripts, we deployed a VPS with our database and then, hosted our backend on it. In addition to Linode, we used GitHub to host all of our code. GitHub made hosting all this a breeze. We also used Auth0 to create a login feature for the website. LOP API was used to create a greeting card for users. CircleCi was used for some of the APIS and Twilio was used for an emergency chatbot. Matlab for image scaling and sizing using grids for positioning of images on template on LOB API. 

# 👨🏾‍💻 Challenges We Ran Into
We had no difficulties registering a domain, or using Linode or GitHub. There were some problems implementing CircleCI as we had never used it before but overall we were able to figure out every tool and create an API with it.

# 👍 Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Linode's built-in stack support made it a breeze to host everything. The hosting is crucial part for our website and to avoid having a slow server that we had to run ourselves, we decided to host on the cloud, and chose Linode’s easy-to-use service to do so. This process was very streamlined and we’re proud we managed to host it on this platform.

# 📙 What We Learned
This was our first time using Auth0, and it was pretty easy to figure out how to use it. It was also our first time using Lop API and CircleCI.

# 🔜 What's Next For Health Miscalled Us
This project is amazing, but has a lot of points to improve upon. A better user interface can be added, and a chatbot could possibly be created. The tools can have more features, too.
